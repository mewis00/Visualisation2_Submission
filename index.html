                Despite America's gunlaws allegedly promoting saftey and protection, the empiracal evidence suggests that it does quite the opposite. <br><br>
                There have been 100s of shootings over the years but this data set has captured <b>126 mass shootings</b> between 1982-2022 which were the worst. <br>

                Locations such as <b>Florida, California and Texas </b> are some of the more common American states to have mass shootings, and generally they
                 occur in more <b>heavily populated</b> locations <br><br>
                The most noteable mass shooting was the <b>Las Vegas Strip Massacare </b>in 2017 which had over 600 victims
